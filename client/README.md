# Weather Application

This application will look to communicate with a weather API to provide live weather updates for 200,000 possible locations. 

The end target is for the user to be able to search for a location and retrieve the live weather for that particular location.

NOTE - Will need to add your own API key into App.js in order for application to successfully communicate with the Open Weather Map API.

This will be built using the React.js framework.
