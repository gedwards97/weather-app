# Weather Application
A web based application built with React, Node, and PostgreSQL.

This application will look to communicate with a weather API to provide live weather updates for 200,000 possible locations, as well as 7 day forecasts for major UK cities. Have finished working on this for now to begin another project, and there is definitely still some improvements to be made. Some components are pretty messy, and when I find some time I will clean up the project.

NOTE - Will need to add your own API key into App.js in order for application to successfully communicate with the Open Weather Map API. And aso run the relatively simple backend server in order for the 7 day forecast componentn work.
